    "# How to set the audio levels?\n",
    "The following settings can be adjusted:\n",
    "1. PC audio output attenuation\n",
    "2. Transmitter analog input attenuation (by addition of external resistor divider)\n",
    "3. Receiver analog output attenuation by the user turning the volume knob.\n",
    "4. PC analog input attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set these so that the generated audio will never be overdriven.  This might however lead to too low audio levels in some cases.  I'm no expert in this domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. PC audio output attenuation\n",
    "Software setting, can be controlled on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Analog input attenuation\n",
    "The analog output of the sound card will be divided with a 1K/33ohm divider (placed close ot the microphone input) and then capacitively coupled to the microphone input of the transmitter. The transmitter has a high input impedance, which is noise sensitive.  \n",
    "We could omit the resistor divider and use the output volume control of the sound card, but the output volume setting must be set so low that the S/N ratio will be bad.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Receiver analog output attenuation\n",
    "The volume knob of the receiver can be turned a quarter of a turn open.  This position can be marked with paint or a sticker.  If the volume knob is turned over halfway, the distortion will increase.  The user must be instructed to never turn the volume knob over the marked position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. PC analog input attenuation\n",
    "This is software controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating a 0dBFS audio signal, with PC output volume set to 100% (0dB attenuation), the maximum output signal of the sound card is used.\n",

    "We then adjust the resistor divider on the transmitter so that the received audio is not distorted.  As such, we make sure that the audio will not be overdriven in any case.\n",

    "## Test setup\n",
    "1. Audio output level of USB-sound card set to 100%.\n",
    "2. Generate a 0dBFS 1kHz sine wave using REW.\n",
    "3. USB-sound card input connected to Yaesu's analog input using a resistor divider (potmeter) and a capacitor.\n",
    "4. Connect PTT-switch to Yaesu FT65-E analog input.\n",
    "5. Set analog input level of USB-sound card to 18%.\n",
    "6. Connect analog output of Midland G9-Pro directly to USB sound card input.\n",
    "7. Start transmitting by pushing PTT-switch.\n",

    "The PTT-switch connects a 2.2kΩ resistor to the Yaesu's analog input.  This causes the Yaesu to start transmitting.\n",

    "An analog interface between the sound card and the Yaesu FT65-E has been designed.  Later tests will show that this interface is capable of transferring Rattlegram datagrams."
