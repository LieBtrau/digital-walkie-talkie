    "### Radio settings\n",
    "European version of the FT-65 can listen to PMR446, but is not allowed to transmit on that band.  Transmission on PMR446 is only allowed with PMR446-certified radios (fixed antenna, TX-power limited to 0.5W, ...), which the FT-65E is clearly not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's however technically possible to use a Yaesu FT-65E on PMR446:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand TX-range of a Yaesu FT-65E outside the ham-bands using this guide [here](https://simonthewizard.com/2017/12/17/yaesu-ft-65-expand/).\n",
    "2. Set the following menu options in the FT-65E:\n",
    "    32 : TX Power : LOW (which is 0.5W)\n",
    "    37 : WIDE/NAR : NARROW (+/-2.5kHz deviation), when set to wide the Midland cuts off reception above 800Hz.\n",
    "3. Set the TX-frequency equal to that of a PMR446-radio.\n",
    "4. Frequency step : 30 : Step : 6.25kHz\n",
    "5. Squelch type:\n",
    "  1. CTCSS:\n",
    "     * 8 : CTCSS : set up the same as a PMR446-radio.  On Kenwood PMR446 handsets, this will be called \"Quiet Talk (QT)\" setting, but it's essentially the same thing.\n",
    "     * 29 : SQL Type : TSQL\n",
    "  2. DCS:\n",
    "     * 11 : DCS-code : e.g. RX : 754, TX : 754\n",
    "     * 29 : SQL Type : DCS\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Antenna\n",
    "During the tests:\n",
    "* Set the TX power level (32:TX PWR) to LOW (0.5W)\n",
    "* Replace the antenna by an RP-SMA to SMA adapter and add a 50Ω terminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Audio IO\n",
    "Don't turn the volume knob more than 50% to avoid distortion.  \n",
    "Maximum undistorted audio output is 4.65Vpp, 1.85Voffset at 1kHz.\n",
    "Maximum analog input voltage peak-peak for the Yaesu FT-65E = **30mVpp**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TX-Delay\n",
    "This is the delay needed between pushing the PTT-button and the FT-65E being ready to transmit.  The delay is measured using a 1kHz sine wave signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From Yaesu PTT-down to Midland G9 Pro opening its squelch = <144ms.\n",
    "* From Yaesu PTT-down to Midland G9 Pro which has squelch-open all the time = <110ms.  Most of the times, it's between 80ms and 100ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TX-Tail\n",
    "This is the delay needed between releasing the PTT-button and the FT-65E stopping to transmit.  The delay is measured using a 1kHz sine wave signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From Yaesu PTT-up to Midland G9 Pro (squeltch-open all the time) = <170ms.  Most of the times, it's between 120ms and 140ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motorola M1 connector : 7.62mm spacing between TRS-jacks.\n",
    "* The threaded insert has an unknown screw thread.  It's close to M2.5, but not exactly the same.\n",
    "* 3.5mm : \n",
    "  * Tip = speaker- (Vcm = 2.5V)\n",
    "    * Jumps to 2V when squelch is open.  Audio max = 4V (with respect to GND)\n",
    "  * Ring = ?\n",
    "    * internal 10K PU to 3V3, unknown purpose\n",
    "    * Short circuited to sleeve when using the SSM-17B Hand speaker Mic. Maybe that's the reason why Yaesu doesn't market the SSM-17B as an accessory to the FT-65.  The SSM-512B is advised instead.\n",
    "  * Sleeve = speaker+ (Vcm = 2.5V)\n",
    "* 2.5mm : \n",
    "  * Tip = Connect a PTT switch in series with electret-MIC (1K8 or 2K2 internal resistance) connected to GND.  Function generator outputs must be AC-coupled to this input, otherwise the PTT functionality no longer works correctly.\n",
    "  * Ring = RX/TX line\n",
    "    * RX/TX Short circuited to sleeve when using the SSM-17B Hand speaker Mic.\n",
    "    * Use open drain TX and connect it to RX.  \n",
    "    * To interface to a standard UART: connect the anode of a diode to the UART-RX. Connect the cathode of that same diode to the UART-TX. \n",
    "  * Sleeve = GND\n",
