# Radio communication modes
There are few options available for radios having only 1kHz bandwidth.  The problem is that there's no access to the modulator.  There's no way to skip the 460Hz to 1.2kHz filter.
I see no way to make digital voice work.  Digital keyboard-to-keyboard communication could work, but it would be very spectrum inefficient.

## RTTY
* Several frequency shifts possible : https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Radio_Teletype_(RTTY)

## QPSK31
32baud

## MT63-2000L
2kHz BW = 20baud
* Fldigi (also on linux) , with GUI
