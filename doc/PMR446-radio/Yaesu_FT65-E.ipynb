    "### Radio settings\n",
    "European version of the FT-65 can listen to PMR446, but is not allowed to transmit on that band.  Transmission on PMR446 is only allowed with PMR446-certified radios (fixed antenna, TX-power limited to 0.5W, ...), which the FT-65E is clearly not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's however technically possible to use a Yaesu FT-65E on PMR446:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand TX-range of a Yaesu FT-65E outside the ham-bands using this guide [here](https://simonthewizard.com/2017/12/17/yaesu-ft-65-expand/).\n",
    "2. Set the following menu options in the FT-65E:\n",
    "    32 : TX Power : LOW (which is 0.5W)\n",
    "    37 : WIDE/NAR : NARROW (+/-2.5kHz deviation), when set to wide the Midland cuts off reception above 800Hz.\n",
    "3. Set the TX-frequency equal to that of a PMR446-radio.\n",
    "4. Frequency step : 30 : Step : 6.25kHz\n",
    "5. Squelch type:\n",
    "  1. CTCSS:\n",
    "     * 8 : CTCSS : set up the same as a PMR446-radio.  On Kenwood PMR446 handsets, this will be called \"Quiet Talk (QT)\" setting, but it's essentially the same thing.\n",
    "     * 29 : SQL Type : TSQL\n",
    "  2. DCS:\n",
    "     * 11 : DCS-code : e.g. RX : 754, TX : 754\n",
    "     * 29 : SQL Type : DCS\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Antenna\n",
    "During the tests:\n",
    "* Set the TX power level (32:TX PWR) to LOW (0.5W)\n",
    "* Replace the antenna by an RP-SMA to SMA adapter and add a 50Ω terminator.\n",

    "* 3.5mm : \n",
    "  * Tip = speaker- (Vcm = 2.5V)\n",
    "    * Jumps to 2V when squelch is open.  Audio max = 4V (with respect to GND)\n",
    "  * Ring = ?\n",
    "    * internal 10K PU to 3V3, unknown purpose\n",
    "    * Short circuited to sleeve when using the SSM-17B Hand speaker Mic. Maybe that's the reason why Yaesu doesn't market the SSM-17B as an accessory to the FT-65.  The SSM-512B is advised instead.\n",
    "  * Sleeve = speaker+ (Vcm = 2.5V)\n",
    "* 2.5mm : \n",
    "  * Tip = Connect a PTT switch in series with electret-MIC (1K8 or 2K2 internal resistance) connected to GND.  Function generator outputs must be AC-coupled to this input, otherwise the PTT functionality no longer works correctly.\n",
    "  * Ring = RX/TX line\n",
    "    * RX/TX Short circuited to sleeve when using the SSM-17B Hand speaker Mic.\n",
    "    * Use open drain TX and connect it to RX.  \n",
    "    * To interface to a standard UART: connect the anode of a diode to the UART-RX. Connect the cathode of that same diode to the UART-TX. \n",
    "  * Sleeve = GND\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Audio input test\n",
    "#### Test setup\n",
    "1. Set frequency generator to output 1kHz sine wave, 10mVpp to 50mVpp\n",
    "2. Connect output of frequency generator with a 2.2µF capacitor to the radio analog input.  The AC-coupling is needed, otherwise the function generator will mess up with the PTT-detection circuit of the radio.\n",
    "3. Connect a 2.2K resistor from the radio analog input with a PTT-switch to GND.\n",
    "4. Oscilloscope channel 1 = analog input of the radio\n",
    "5. Oscilloscope channel 2 = analog output of the Midland G9Pro\n",
    "6. Do an FFT-operation on channel 2 of the scope, to determine harmonic distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./measurements/Yaesu_analog_in.png\" alt=\"Yaesu FT-65E analog input\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements show that as the amplitude increases, the second harmonic remains about 35dB below the fundamental.  At some point, the 3rd harmonic will rise rapidly.  \n",
    "We determine the maximum amplitude of the analog input of the radio as the amplitude where the peak of the 3rd harmonic equals the peak of the 2nd harmonic.\n",
    "Maximum analog input voltage peak-peak for the Yaesu FT-65E = 30mVpp\n",
