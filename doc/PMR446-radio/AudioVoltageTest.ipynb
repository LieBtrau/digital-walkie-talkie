    "    * Option 2 : Use the scope functionality of [REW](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) to check that you're not overloading the input of your USB-sound card.  If so, decrease input audio volume : e.g. `$ pactl set-source-volume alsa_input.usb-GeneralPlus_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo 50%`.  Use the RTA tool in [REW](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) to check for harmonic distortion.\n",
