    "  * channels 9 to 16 : with CTCSS fixed to code 16 (114.8 Hz)\n",

    "    * Option 1 : Connect a PTT switch in series with electret-MIC (1K internal resistance)\n",

    "* Maximum audio output level is about 3Vpp.  Be careful : turning your volume knob open too far will cause your audio to clip, causing heavy distorted sound.\n",
    "* Vcm when no audio is present = 2.40V\n",
    "* Vcm when producing audio at max amplitude = 2.50V\n"
