    "# LoRa versus FSK\n",
    "Two parameters are important here : sensitivity and adjacent channel blocking or selectivity.  Sensitivity is the minimum signal strength that can be received.  Blocking is the ability to receive a signal in the presence of a strong signal.  Sensitivity is important for long range communication, while blocking is important for multiple access communication.  \n",

    "### 2FSK\n",
    "* Frequency deviation (Δf) = the difference between the minimum and maximum extent of a frequency modulated signal, and the nominal center or carrier frequency.  \n",
    "$$f_{carrier} - f_{min} = f_{max} - f_{carrier} = \\Delta f$$\n",
    "* The relation between bandwidth (BW) and bitrate (BR) is defined by [Carson's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_bandwidth_rule) : $$BW = 2*(\\Delta f+\\frac{BR}{2}) = BR+2*\\Delta f$$\n",
    "* Modulation index : $$m = \\frac{2*\\Delta f}{BR}$$\n",
    "  * MSK : Minimum Shift Keying : m = 0.5 -> Δf = BR/4\n",
    "  * Narrowband FM when m < 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4FSK\n",
    "* modulation index m (innerdeviation is frequency difference of the two used modulating frequencies): \n",
    "$$m = \\frac{2*innerdeviation}{symbolrate}$$\n",
    "  * 2x more spectrally efficient modulation than 2GFSK.\n",
    "* For the same data rate and modulation index, 4GFSK has about 2dB loss in sensitivity with respect to 2GFSK:\n",
    "  * inner deviation = outer deviation / 3.  For the same data rate the bandwidth is halved, so the inner deviation for 4GFSK is only 1/6 of the frequency deviation of the 2GFSK.  This corresponds to a 5dB loss (depends on modulation index).\n",
    "  * Halving the RX bandwidth for 4GFSK reduces noise power in the modem by 3dB.\n",

    "For LoRa SF7, CR=2 (4/6 = 2 error correction bits per 4 data bits), **BW=250kHz**, bit rate is 9.1kbps.  It's 10.1kbps when CR=1.  For these settings, the SX1278 has a receiver sensitivity of -120 to -122dBm.\n",

Older versions can be installed, but automatic firmware upgrade doesn't work.  A username and password is required for that.  The Silabs website isn't working properly.
