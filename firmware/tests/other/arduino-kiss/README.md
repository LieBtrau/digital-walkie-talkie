# Description
Test Arduino KISS with Android apps

# Instruction
1. Download [Codec2_talkie](https://github.com/sh123/codec2_talkie/releases) Android application.
2. Open your download folder and install it from there.
3. Bind the bluetooth of the ESP32 to your Android device
4. Open the Codec2_talkie app and connect to the ESP32.
5. On the serial port of the ESP32 you'll see the loggings from the KISS-interface.

# Remarks
The [M17 KISS HT](https://github.com/mobilinkd/m17-kiss-ht) Android application is very similar to the [Codec2_talkie](https://github.com/sh123/codec2_talkie/releases), but it doesn't support Bluetooth Connections, only Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
